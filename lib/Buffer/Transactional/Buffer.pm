=head1 NAME

Buffer::Transactional::Buffer - A role to represent a buffer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a role to represent our buffer types.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<put ( @items )>

This method is required, it is used to add elements to
the buffer.

=item B<as_string>

This method is required, it is used to collapse a buffer
into a string.

=item B<subsume ( $buffer )>

This method has a minimal implementation which simply puts
the results of calling C<to_string> on the C<$buffer> arg
into the local buffer. Feel free to override this if it is
not appropriate, see L<Buffer::Transactional::Buffer::Lazy>
for an example of this.
